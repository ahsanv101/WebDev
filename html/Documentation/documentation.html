                <h5>Introduction:</h5>
                <p><i>Latin Yersinia pestis</i>, it was the 1348 Plague that hit Florence, resulting in the death of 3/5 of the population: tens of thousands of humans.<p>
                <p>This epidemy spreads out fast and social conditions soon became cruel: some, scared to death, avoided the infected, others help them finding a cure.</p>
                <p>People abandoned family and friends, stopped working, fled cities and shut themselves off from the world. Some felt that the wrath of God was descending upon humanity, so they prayed for Him.</p>
                <p>Read this poem of the 17th century describing the scared and scary stereotypical <i>Plague Doctors</i></p>
                <p class="vaigiu" id="doctor">As may be seen on picture here,
                  In Rome the doctors do appear,
                  When to their patients they are called,
                  In places by the plague appalled,
                  Their hats and cloaks, of fashion new,
                  Are made of oilcloth, dark of hue,
                  Their caps with glasses are designed,
                  Their bills with antidotes all lined,
                  That foulsome air may do no harm,
                  Nor cause the doctor man alarm,
                  The staff in hand must serve to show
                  Their noble trade where'er they go
                  Poem of the 17th century.

                <p class="vaigiu">A simple batterium called Coccobacilius formed this terrifying social experiment leading people to totally lose control.</p>

                <p class="vaigiu">One of the witnesses of the Black Death was Boccaccio: an italian writer and real life testimony of the Black Death in Florence. </p>

                <p>For efficiency of the documentation Here is the Decameron Preface where Boccaccio focused on the degrade of humanity. For clarity of reasons we will show both the Italian (original) and English extracts.</p>

E dalle due parti del corpo predette infra brieve spazio cominciò il già detto gavocciolo mortifero indifferentemente in ogni parte di quello a nascere e a venire: e da questo appresso s'incominciò la qualità della predetta infermità a permutare in macchie nere o livide, le quali nelle braccia e per le cosce e in ciascuna altra parte del corpo apparivano a molti, a cui grandi e rade e a cui minute e spesse. E come il gavocciolo primieramente era stato e ancora era certissimo indizio di futura morte, così erano queste a ciascuno a cui venieno.

                <p class="vaigiu">“Grande moria”, or “Black Death” originated in the big Asian continent, probably in Mongolia. From there, the plague spread through the Silk Road and reached Samarcanda to then spread all over Middle East. The major infectors were rats and fleas: nurtured with the blood of infected animals, they transmited the bacterion to healthy rats and humans. The disease effect was incresead by the life condicions and the inexistant hygene, it was impossible to limit the infection. 
                  The syntoms were buboes and bulges, resulting in fast deaths.</p>
                <p class="vaigiu">What Boccaccio shows us is the dissolvment of any societal form or of any human relationship.</p>
                <p class="vaigiu">Who survived, rich or poor, knew they escaped an epochal scourge.</p>
                <h5>How I applied:</h5>
                <p>I took inspiration from the blood shed by the Plague to build a drop falling down from the center of the title. This drop animation runs forever.</p>
                <p> The Disclaimer background depicts the terrifying Plague Doctors. Their typical costume consisted of an ankle-length overcoat and a bird-like beak mask, often filled with sweet or strong-smelling substances to protect themself. along with gloves, boots, a wide-brimmed hat, and an outer over-clothing garment. They became a symbol of Death, so I opted for them for satiritical as well as symbolic purposes.</p>

                <h3>
                  Colonization
                </h3>
                <h4>
                  1800-1900
                </h4>
                <h5>Introduction:</h5>
                <p>This theme will highlight the important aspects of design and styles that were adopted in the colonization of
                   the sub-continent by the British Empire between the colonial rule from 1858 to 1947. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Examples:</h5>
                <br>
                <p>1. This is an example of a typical document produced during this era. As you can see, joined handwriting was a
                  very common style using black ink which was slightly tilted towards either left or right. 
               </p>
               <br>
                <img src="../../images/colexample1.jpg" alt="Example 1" class="doc-img">
                <br>
                <p>2. Most of the paper that was used during this era were parchment papers for both single pages and scrolls.
               </p>
               <br>
                <!-- <img src="../../images/colexample2.jpg" alt="Example 2" class="doc-img"> -->
                <br>
                <p>3. A lot of scrolls and pages during this era were signed off with wax seals. In many cases these seals were pressed
                  with the emblem of the lords or the family. 
               </p>
                <br>
                <img src="../../images/colexample3.jpg" alt="Example 3" class="doc-img">
                <br>
                <p>4. This is a typical example of a scroll style that was used within the Empire during this age. Many messages were
                  written in a scroll like this by the British Empire which were read out loud in public by messengers.
               </p>

                <br>
                <img src="../../images/colexample4.jpg" alt="Example 4" class="doc-img">
                <br>
                <p>5. Another important think that was widely used by the British Empire in this era was invisible ink which was recently developed
                  to send secret messages to other concerning parties
               </p>

                <br>
                <img src="../../images/colexample5.jpg" alt="Example 5" class="doc-img">

                <br>
                <p>6. A very typical style of letters during this era would be to have stamps attached to them. Usually they have very sepia-like colors
                  and dotted borders.
               </p>

                <br>
                <img src="../../images/colexample6.jpg" alt="Example 6" class="doc-img">
                
                <br>
                <h5>How I applied:</h5>
                <br>
                <p>1. The main text that appears on the home page has an effect which highlights how the invisible ink appears 
                  on the pages.
               </p>

               
                <br>
                <p>2. The buttons on the home pages are inspired by wax sealed
               </p>
               <br>
                <p>3. Some drop down link and buttons are inspired by scrolls. In some cases when you hover over them it gives an 
                  effect that the scrolls are opening.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>4. The background is parchment paper themed. They appear to look irregular because thats how many parchment papers
                were combined together to form a long paper.

              </p>
              <br>
               <p>5. The font style is inspired by the handwritings usually found in typical documents of this era of the British Empire.
                
              </p>
              <br>
               <p>6. The pictures that are presented within this theme were shown in a way that they look like typical stamp papers that 
                were typically used at the time period.
              </p>

                    The capability of a class to derive
                    properties and characteristics from
                    another class is called Inheritance.
                    Inheritance is one of the most important
                    feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                    Sub Class: The class that inherits
                    properties from another class
                    is called Sub class or Derived Class.
                    Super Class: The class whose properties
                    are inherited by sub class is called Base
                    Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
                    have to write the functions only one time
                    instead of three times as we
                    have inherited rest of the three classes
                    from base class(Vehicle).

                  The Cold War
                </h3>

                    The word polymorphism means having many
                    forms. In simple words, we can define
                    polymorphism as the ability of a message
                    to be displayed in more than one form.
                    A real-life example of polymorphism, a
                    person at the same time can have
                    different characteristics.
                    Like a man at the same time is a father,
                    a husband, an employee. So the same
                    person posses different behavior in
                    different situations. This is called
                    polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
                    as one of the important features of Object
                    Oriented Programming.
                    <br>
                    <b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
                        divided into two types:</b>
                    <br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
                    2. Runtime Polymorphism

                Conspiracy
              </h3>
              <h4>
                1950-2000
              </h4>
              <h5>Introduction:</h5>
              <p>Here we will cover the most prevelent design aspect during the era of conspiracy theories. Government secrets, aliens among us, 
                confidential files, being watched by aliens etc. are some aspects highlighted here. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <h5>Examples:</h5>
              <br>
              <p>1. One of the most important aspects of these designs were that the secrets or theories were thought to be
                 kept in very old storage or Government facilities. Some of which were actually true. These mostly consisted of old paper with
                 smudged style ink.  A lot of these secret files were guarded by top secret or confidential stamps/markings.
             </p>
             <br>
              <img src="../../images/consexample1.jpg" alt="Example 1" class="doc-img">
              <br>
              <p>2. In many of the conspiracy theories, we see a constant rise of alien speculations. During this era, alot of celebrities and 
              famous people were thought to be aliens, lizards or some species other than humans. 
             </p>
             <br>
              <img src="../../images/consexample2.jpg" alt="Example 2" class="doc-img">
              <br>
              <p>3. There is also a prevelent conspiracy theory about birds. It is believed that birds are not real, specifically targeting pigeons. They are drones made by the 
                Government to spy on us.
             </p>
              <br>
              <img src="../../images/consexample3.jpg" alt="Example 3" class="doc-img">
              <br>
              <p>4. One of the most popular conspiracy theory is of celebrities being part a secret and elite group called 'The Illuminati'.
                In many cases, bright red markings were used on the photos of these celebrities to make highlight the evidence hinting towards their 
                secret life
             </p>

              <br>
              <img src="../../images/consexample4.jpg" alt="Example 4" class="doc-img">
              <br>
              <!-- <p>5. Another important think that was widely used by the British Empire in this era was invisible ink which was recently developed
                to send secret messages to other concerning parties
             </p>

              <br>
              <img src="../../images/colexample5.jpg" alt="Example 5" class="doc-img">

              <br>
              <p>6. A very typical style of letters during this era would be to have stamps attached to them. Usually they have very sepia-like colors
                and dotted borders.
             </p>

              <br>
              <img src="../../images/colexample6.jpg" alt="Example 6" class="doc-img">
              <br> -->


              <h5>How I applied:</h5>
              <br>
              <p>1. On the main page I used a stamp effect showing how files were typically categorized using such stamps
             </p>

             
              <br>
              <p>2. The use of red circles were deployed for buttons
             </p>
             <br>
              <p>3. Use of animations were done such as evil satanic eye and pigeon that spy on us.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>4. Old style paper was used as background in some cases. In another cases files/file paper were used. The idea was to use them
              in such a way that they look like we are accessing some secret documents in a dark room.

            </p>
            <br>
             <p>5. The two main font styles that were used were old printing style and top secret stamp style. 
              
            </p>
            <br>
             <p>6. Pictures are usually shown as inverted which is how many conspiracy theorists used some photos as well as black and white ones.
            </p>

                    In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
                    as wrapping up of data and information
                    under a single unit. In Object Oriented
                    Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
                    binding together the data and the functions
                    that manipulates them. Consider
                    a real life example
                    of encapsulation, in a company there are
                    different sections like the accounts section,
                    finance section, sales section etc. The finance
                    section handles all the financial transactions
                    and keep records of all the data related to
                    finance.
                    Similarly the sales section handles all the
                    sales related activities and keep records of
                    all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                    when for some reason an official from finance
                    section needs all the data about sales in a
                    particular
                    month. In this case, he is not allowed to
                    directly access the data of sales section.
                    He will first have to contact some other
                    officer in the sales section and then
                    request him to
                    give the particular data. This is what
                    encapsulation is. Here the data of
                    sales section and the
                    employees that can manipulate them are
                    wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
