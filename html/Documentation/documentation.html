                </h4>
                <h5>Introduction:</h5>
                <p>This theme will highlight the important aspects of design and styles that were adopted in the colonization of
                   the sub-continent by the British Empire between the colonial rule from 1858 to 1947. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Examples:</h5>
                <br>
                <p>1. This is an example of a typical document produced during this era. As you can see, joined handwriting was a
                  very common style using black ink which was slightly tilted towrds either left or right. 
               </p>
               <br>
                <img src="../../images/colexample1.jpg" alt="Example 1" class="doc-img">
                <br>
                <p>2. Most of the paper that was used during this era were parchment papers for both single pages and scrolls.
               </p>
               <br>
                <!-- <img src="../../images/colexample2.jpg" alt="Example 2" class="doc-img"> -->
                <br>
                <p>3. A lot of scrolls and pages during this era were signed off with wax seals. In many cases these seals were pressed
                  with the emblem of the lords or the family. 
               </p>
                <br>
                <img src="../../images/colexample3.jpg" alt="Example 3" class="doc-img">
                <br>
                <p>4. This is a typical example of a scroll style that was used within the Empire during this age. Many messages were
                  written in a scroll like this by the British Empire which were read out loud in public by messengers.
               </p>

                <br>
                <img src="../../images/colexample4.jpg" alt="Example 4" class="doc-img">
                <br>
                <p>5. Another important think that was widely used by the British Empire in this era was invisible ink which was recently developed
                  to send secret messages to other concerning parties
               </p>

                <br>
                <img src="../../images/colexample5.jpg" alt="Example 5" class="doc-img">

                <br>
                <p>6. A very typical style of letters during this era would be to have stamps attached to them. Usually they have very sepia-like colors
                  and dotted borders.
               </p>

                <br>

                <h5>How I applied:</h5>
                <br>
                <p>1. The main text that appears on the home page has an effect which highlights how the invisible ink appears 
                  on the pages.
               </p>

               
                <br>
                <p>2. The buttons on the home pages are inspired by wax sealed
               </p>
               <br>
                <p>3. Some drop down link and buttons are inspired by scrolls. In some cases when you hover over them it gives an 
                  effect that the scrolls are opening.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>4. The background is parchment paper themed. They appear to look irregular because thats how many parchment papers
                were combined together to form a long paper.

              </p>
              <br>
               <p>5. The font style is inspired by the handwritings usually found in typical documents of this era of the British Empire.
                
              </p>
              <br>
               <p>6. The pictures that are presented within this theme were shown in a way that they look like typical stamp papers that 
                were typically used at the time period.
              </p>

                    The capability of a class to derive
                    properties and characteristics from
                    another class is called Inheritance.
                    Inheritance is one of the most important
                    feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                    Sub Class: The class that inherits
                    properties from another class
                    is called Sub class or Derived Class.
                    Super Class: The class whose properties
                    are inherited by sub class is called Base
                    Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
                    have to write the functions only one time
                    instead of three times as we
                    have inherited rest of the three classes
                    from base class(Vehicle).

                    The word polymorphism means having many
                    forms. In simple words, we can define
                    polymorphism as the ability of a message
                    to be displayed in more than one form.
                    A real-life example of polymorphism, a
                    person at the same time can have
                    different characteristics.
                    Like a man at the same time is a father,
                    a husband, an employee. So the same
                    person posses different behavior in
                    different situations. This is called
                    polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
                    as one of the important features of Object
                    Oriented Programming.
                    <br>
                    <b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
                        divided into two types:</b>
                    <br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>

              </p>
              <br>
              <h5>Examples:</h5>
              <br>
              <p>1. One of the most important aspects of these designs were that the secrets or theories were thought to be
                 kept in very old storage or Government facilities. Some of which were actually true. These mostly consisted of old paper with
                 smudged style ink.  A lot of these secret files were guarded by top secret or confidential stamps/markings.
             </p>

              <br>
              <p>2. In many of the conspiracy theories, we see a constant rise of alien speculations. During this era, alot of celebrities and 
              famous people were thought to be aliens, lizards or some species other than humans. 
             </p>

              <br>
              <p>3. There is also a prevelent conspiracy theory about birds. It is believed that birds are not real, specifically targeting pigeons. They are drones made by the 
                Government to spy on us.
             </p>
              <br>
              <img src="../../images/consexample3.jpg" alt="Example 3" class="doc-img">
              <br>
              <p>4. One of the most popular conspiracy theory is of celebrities being part a secret and elite group called 'The Illuminati'.
                In many cases, bright red markings were used on the photos of these celebrities to make highlight the evidence hinting towards their 
                secret life
             </p>

              <br>
              <img src="../../images/consexample4.jpg" alt="Example 4" class="doc-img">
              <br>
              <!-- <p>5. Another important think that was widely used by the British Empire in this era was invisible ink which was recently developed
                to send secret messages to other concerning parties
             </p>

              <br>

              <br>
              <p>6. A very typical style of letters during this era would be to have stamps attached to them. Usually they have very sepia-like colors
                and dotted borders.
             </p>

              <h5>How I applied:</h5>
              <br>
              <p>1. On the main page I used a stamp effect showing how files were typically categorized using such stamps
             </p>

             
              <br>
              <p>2. The use of red circles were deployed for buttons
             </p>
             <br>
              <p>3. Use of animations were done such as evil satanic eye and pigeon that spy on us.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>4. Old style paper was used as background in some cases. In another cases files/file paper were used. The idea was to use them
              in such a way that they look like we are accessing some secret documents in a dark room.

            </p>
            <br>
             <p>5. The two main font styles that were used were old printing style and top secret stamp style. 
              
            </p>
            <br>
             <p>6. Pictures are usually shown as inverted which is how many conspiracy theorists used some photos as well as black and white ones.
            </p>

                    In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
                    as wrapping up of data and information
                    under a single unit. In Object Oriented
                    Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
                    binding together the data and the functions
                    that manipulates them. Consider
                    a real life example
                    of encapsulation, in a company there are
                    different sections like the accounts section,
                    finance section, sales section etc. The finance
                    section handles all the financial transactions
                    and keep records of all the data related to
                    finance.
                    Similarly the sales section handles all the
                    sales related activities and keep records of
                    all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                    when for some reason an official from finance
                    section needs all the data about sales in a
                    particular
                    month. In this case, he is not allowed to
                    directly access the data of sales section.
                    He will first have to contact some other
                    officer in the sales section and then
                    request him to
                    give the particular data. This is what
                    encapsulation is. Here the data of
                    sales section and the
                    employees that can manipulate them are
                    wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
