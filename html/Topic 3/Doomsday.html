	<h1>At doom’s doorstep:<br>
	    It is 100 seconds to midnight</h1>
	<h2>2022 <span class="event">Doomsday</span> Clock Statement</h2>
	
	<p>Last year’s leadership change in the United States provided hope that what seemed like a global race toward <span class="concepts">catastrophe</span> might be halted and—with renewed <span class="place">US</span> engagement—even reversed. Indeed, in 2021 the new American administration changed <span class="place">US</span> policies in some ways that made the world safer: agreeing to an extension of the New START arms control agreement and beginning strategic stability talks with <span class="place">Russia</span>; announcing that the United States</span> would seek to return to the Iran <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> deal; and rejoining the Paris climate accord. Perhaps even more heartening was the return of <span class="concepts">science</span> and evidence to <span class="place">US</span> policy making in general, especially regarding the <span class="concepts">COVID-19</span> <span class="concepts">pandemic</span>. A more moderate and predictable approach to leadership and the control of one of the two largest <span class="concepts">nuclear </span>arsenals of the world marked a welcome change from the previous four years.</p>
	
	<p>Still, the change in <span class="place">US</span> leadership alone was not enough to reverse negative international security trends that had been long in<span class="concepts"> developing</span> and continued across the threat horizon in 2021.</p>

	<p><span class="place">US</span> relations with <span class="place">Russia</span> and <span class="place">China</span> remain tense, with all three countries engaged in an array of <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> modernization and expansion efforts—including <span class="place">China</span>’s apparent large-scale program to increase its deployment of silo-based long-range <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> missiles; the push by <span class="place">Russia</span>, <span class="place">China</span>, and the United States to <span class="concepts">develop</span> hypersonic missiles; and the continued testing of anti-satellite weapons by many nations. If not restrained, these efforts could mark the start of a dangerous new <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> arms race. Other <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> <span class="concepts">concerns</span>, including <span class="place">North Korea</span>’s unconstrained <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> and missile expansion and the (as yet) unsuccessful attempts to revive the Iran <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> deal contribute to growing dangers. Ukraine remains a potential flashpoint, and <span class="place">Russian</span> troop deployments to the Ukrainian border heighten day-to-day tensions.</p>
	
	<p>For many countries, a huge gap still exists between long-term greenhouse gas-reduction pledges and the near- and medium-term emission-reduction actions needed to achieve those goals. Although the new <span class="place">US</span> administration’s quick return to the <span class="event">Paris Agreement</span> speaks the right words, it has yet to be matched with actionable policies.</p>

	<p><span class="concepts">Developed</span> countries improved their responses to the continuing <span class="concepts">COVID-19</span> <span class="concepts">pandemic</span> in 2021, but the worldwide response remained entirely insufficient. <span class="concepts">Plans</span> for quick global distribution of <span class="concepts">vaccines</span> essentially collapsed, leaving poorer countries largely unvaccinated and allowing new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to gain an unwelcome foothold. Beyond the <span class="concepts">pandemic</span>, worrying biosafety and biosecurity lapses made it clear that the international community needs to focus serious attention on management of the global biological research enterprise. Further, the establishment and pursuit of biological weapons programs marked the beginning of a new biological arms race.</p>

	<p>And while the new <span class="place">US</span> administration made progress in reestablishing the role of <span class="concepts">science</span> and evidence in <span class="person">public</span> policy, corruption of the information ecosystem continued apace in 2021. One particularly <span class="concepts">concerning</span> variety of internet-based disinformation infected America last year: Waves of internet-enabled lies persuaded a significant portion of the <span class="place">US</span> <span class="person">public</span> to believe the utterly false narrative contending that <span class="person">Joe Biden</span> did not win the <span class="place">US </span>presidential election in 2020. Continued efforts to foster this narrative threaten to undermine <span class="event">future</span> <span class="place">US</span> elections, American democracy in general, and, therefore, the United States’ ability to lead global efforts to manage existential risk.</p>

	<p>In view of this mixed threat environment—with some positive <span class="concepts">developments</span> counteracted by worrisome and accelerating negative trends—the members of the <span class="concepts">Science</span> and Security Board find the world to be no safer than it was last year at this <span class="concepts">time</span> and therefore decide to set the <span class="event">Doomsday</span> Clock once again at 100 seconds to midnight. This decision does not, by any means, suggest that the international security situation has stabilized. On the contrary, the Clock remains the closest it has ever been to civilization-ending apocalypse because the world remains stuck in an extremely dangerous moment. In 2019 we called it the new abnormal, and it has unfortunately persisted.</p>

	<p>Last year, despite laudable efforts by some leaders and the <span class="person">public</span>, negative trends in <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> and biological weapons, <span class="concepts">climate change</span>, and a variety of disruptive technologies—all exacerbated by a corrupted information ecosphere that undermines rational decision making—kept the world within a stone’s throw of apocalypse. Global leaders and the <span class="person">public</span> are not moving with anywhere near the speed or unity needed to prevent <span class="concepts">disaster</span>.</p>

	<p>Leaders around the world must immediately commit themselves to renewed cooperation in the many ways and venues available for reducing existential risk. <span class="person">Citizens</span> of the world can and should organize to demand that their leaders do so—and quickly. The doorstep of doom is no place to loiter.</p>
	
	<h3>The <span class="concepts">nuclear </span>tightrope</h3>
	
	<p>During 2021, some <span class="concepts">nuclear </span>risks declined while others rose. Upcoming decisions on <span class="concepts">nuclear </span>policies could generate either salutary or dangerous modifications of an already uncertain and worrisome security situation.</p>

	<p>The February 2021 agreement between the <span class="place">United States</span> and <span class="place">Russia</span> to renew New START for five years is a decidedly positive <span class="concepts">development</span>. This extension creates a window of opportunity to negotiate a <span class="event">future</span> arms control agreement between the two countries that possess 90 percent of the <span class="concepts">nuclear </span>weapons on the planet. The <span class="place">United States</span> and <span class="place">Russia</span> also agreed to start two sets of dialogues about how to best maintain “<span class="concepts">nuclear</span> stability” in the <span class="event">future</span>: the Working Group on Principles and Objectives for <span class="event">Future </span>Arms Control and the Working Group on Capabilities and Actions with Strategic Effects. These groups have met and in early 2022 are expected to report on initial results of the consultations, aimed at shaping <span class="event">future</span> arms control agreements.</p>

	<p>Another bright spot was the <span class="person">Biden </span> administration's announcements that it would seek to return to the Joint Comprehensive <span class="concepts">Plan</span> of Action (JCPOA) with Iran and offer to enter strategic stability talks with <span class="place">China</span>. Although no talks between <span class="place">North Korea</span> and the <span class="place">United States</span> took place in 2021, the <span class="place">North Koreans</span> have not resumed testing of <span class="concepts">nuclear </span>weapons or long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).  (Tests of shorter-range missiles have continued.) Finally, when the <span class="person"> Biden </span> administration began its <span class="concepts">Nuclear </span>Posture Review (NPR) process, it announced that one specific goal would be to “reduce the role of <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons” in <span class="place">US</span> national security policy.</p>

	<p>Other <span class="concepts">developments</span>, however, appeared on the negative side of the ledger:</p>

	<p>Iran continues to build an enriched uranium stockpile, insisting that all sanctions be removed before returning to talks with the <span class="place">United States on the JCPOA. The window of opportunity seems to be closing. Over <span class="concepts">time</span>, Iran's neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia, may feel compelled to acquire similar capabilities, foreshadowing the frightening possibility of a Middle East with multiple countries with the expertise and material to build <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons.</p>

	<p>The Chinese have started to build new ICBM silos on a large scale, leading to <span class="concepts">concerns</span> that <span class="place">China</span> may be considering a change in its <span class="concepts">nuclear </span>doctrine. <span class="place">China</span> and <span class="place">Russia</span> have both tested anti-satellite weapons recently, increasing <span class="concepts">concerns</span> about rapid escalation in any conventional conflict with the United States. Efforts by all three countries to field hypersonic missiles are beginning to yield results, intensifying competition. While experts disagree on both the causes and the consequences of these programs, they clearly mark the start of a new arms competition.</p>

	</figure> 

	<p>The <span class="place">North Koreans</span> continue to test <span class="concepts">nuclear</span>-capable short- and medium-range missiles, including cruise, ballistic, and glide vehicles, and there is evidence of their restarting plutonium production. Meanwhile, there have been no high-level negotiations between the <span class="place">United States</span> and <span class="place">North Korea</span>. India and Pakistan continue to advance their <span class="concepts">nuclear</span>, missile, and other military capabilities with no diminution of possible flash points that could lead to <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> conflict.</p>

	<p>As the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the <span class="place">US</span> Capitol demonstrated, no country is immune from threats to its democracy, and in a state with <span class="concepts">nuclear</span>-weapons-usable material and <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons, both can be targets for terrorists and fanatics. Notably, the insurrectionists came close to capturing Vice President Mike Pence and the “<span class="concepts">nuclear </span>football” that accompanies the vice president as the backup system for <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> launch commands. More than 10 percent of those charged with crimes during the January 6th insurrection were veterans or active service members. The Pentagon has conducted a major review of extremism in the military and has adopted new definitions of extremist activities in an attempt to reduce this danger in the <span class="event">future</span>. The seriousness of the problem is clear.</p>

	<p>Finally, the United States is preparing a <span class="concepts">Nuclear</span> Posture Review to guide <span class="place">US</span> strategy, policy, and deployments of <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons, but its overall message appears not yet decided. We hope the document will assert that the United States will reduce the role of <span class="concepts">nuclear </span>weapons in its deterrence and defense policies, which in turn may positively affect the <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons postures of other countries, leading, we believe, to a safer world. Where we set the Clock next year will be influenced by what the <span class="concepts">Nuclear </span>Posture Review ultimately contains. Reports of <span class="event">congressional</span> interference in the process, resulting in the firing of personnel conducting the review, suggests unwelcome politicization that could well affect the outcome and make more rational <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons policies hard to effect.</p>

	<h3><span class="concepts">Climate change</span>: Lots of words, relatively little action</h3>
	
	<p>This past year’s climate negotiations in Glasgow marked an important milestone in climate multilateralism: a critical first round of the treaty’s cycle of upgrading national efforts. Countries were under pressure to strengthen their emission-reduction pledges significantly relative to their pledges six years ago in Paris. The results, unfortunately, were insufficient. <span class="place">China</span> and India affirmed that they would move away from use of coal, but only gradually; they affirmed for the first <span class="concepts">time</span> the objective of achieving “net zero,” but only in 2060 and 2070, respectively. There was only partial progress toward defined accounting rules to allow international markets for greenhouse gas emissions and removals to <span class="concepts">develop</span>. <span class="concepts">Developed</span> countries again failed to follow through on treaty commitments to provide necessary financial and technological support. Overall, countries’ projections and<span class="concepts"> plans</span> for <span class="concepts">fossil fuel </span>production are far from adequate to achieve the global Paris goals to limit the warming of the surface of the planet to “well below two degrees Celsius” (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) relative to the temperature around 1800, at the beginning of the industrial revolution.</p>

	<p>Encouragingly, several countries (as well as financial institutions and corporations) have announced a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions for the long term—meaning by 2050 or thereabouts. These announcements are significant, in that reaching zero aggregate carbon dioxide emissions globally would halt the buildup of greenhouse gas pollution in the atmosphere, which is absolutely critical to halting yet more warming. Earnest efforts to reach these seemingly distant targets require concerted actions in the immediate term, including a redirection of investment away from the production and use of <span class="concepts">fossil fuel </span> and toward renewables and energy efficiency, massive upgrading of existing infrastructure, and a shift in land use and agriculture practices. The real test of the significance of these net-zero pledges will be whether they are matched by near- and medium-term emission-reduction actions.</p>

    <figure>

	<figcaption>Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, 1990-2021. Despite declining in 2020, global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions remained at 31.5 gigatonnes, which contributed to carbon dioxide reaching its highest ever average annual concentration in the atmosphere of 412.5 parts per million in 2020—around 50 percent higher than when the Industrial Revolution began. In 2021, emissions increased to nearly match their 2019 peak. (Chart courtesy of IEA Global Energy Review 2021)</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>Last year, we noted optimistically the election of a <span class="place">US</span> president who <span class="opinions">“acknowledges <span class="concepts">climate change</span> as a profound threat and supports international cooperation and <span class="concepts">science</span>-based policy,” </span> and we’ve seen a dramatic change in tone from the previous presidential administration.  Recognizing that “[t]he effects we are seeing of <span class="concepts">climate change</span> are the crisis of our generation,” <span class="person"> Biden </span> has indeed attempted to move forward quickly, reentering the United States in the <span class="event">Paris Agreement</span> and announcing the United States’ updated Paris emission pledge of a 50 percent reduction by 2030. He has also signaled an attentiveness to the connection between climate action and environmental justice, in both the domestic and international contexts. He has committed to making climate investments in disadvantaged communities within the United States, and at the UN General Assembly meeting he pledged to double climate financing to <span class="concepts">developing</span> countries.</p>

	<p>However, progress achievable through the <span class="place">US</span> political process is highly constrained and fragile, as any subsequent president may try to swing the pendulum backward. The major infrastructure package passed in 2021 is less of a “climate bill” than the <span class="person"> Biden </span> administration initially proposed, and the fate of the climate goals of the “Build Back Better” bill hangs in the balance of a starkly divided <span class="event">Congress</span>. It thus is not yet clear how much progress the United States will make in the coming year toward its announced emissions reduction pledge and finance promise.</p>

	<p>For over four decades the threat of <span class="concepts">climate change</span> to “<span class="event">future</span> generations” has been ruefully noted. As warming has continued to drive up temperatures—from an unprecedented extreme high temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the Siberian Arctic to the record-breaking 2021 “heat dome” over western Canada and the United States—today’s young people are increasingly seeing themselves as the <span class="event">future</span> victims. They are witnessing human and ecosystem tragedies caused, for example, by droughts in eastern Africa and the United States, floods in <span class="place">China</span> and Europe, and wildfires raging around the world, harbingers of yet more dire consequences as <span class="concepts">climate change</span> accelerates in their lifetimes.</p>

	<p>The experience of a deepening crisis has animated <span class="event">protests</span> and other civil society expressions of alarm this year. These have occurred at major political events (such as the <span class="event">G7 Summit</span>), by youth climate movements (such as the student-led Fridays for <span class="event">Future</span> <span class="event">protests</span> around the world), at September’s Climate Week in New York, at COP26 in Glasgow, and at individual sites of proposed new <span class="concepts">fossil fuel</span> infrastructure (such as Line 3 in the United States, the Trans Mountain Pipeline in Canada, and the EACOP pipeline in Uganda and Tanzania). These actions focus <span class="person">public</span> attention on <span class="concepts">climate change</span> and raise its political salience, but whether they will transform policies, investments, and behaviors remains among the most important questions facing global society.</p>

	<h3>The burgeoning biological threat to civilization</h3>

	<p>For years, the <span class="place">United States</span> and many other countries underinvested in defense against natural, accidental, and intentional biological threats. They also underestimated the impacts that a biological threat could have on the entire world. <span class="concepts">COVID-19</span> revealed vulnerabilities in every country and the world’s collective ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from infectious <span class="concepts">disease</span> outbreaks.</p>

	<p>The <span class="concepts">COVID-19</span>  <span class="concepts">pandemic </span>rightly has absorbed the world’s attention, given its demonstrated ability to sicken and kill millions, weaken national economies and global supply chains, and destabilize governments and societies. And yet, what the world has experienced during this <span class="concepts">pandemic</span> is nowhere close to a worst-case scenario.</p>

	<p>To deal with the crisis at hand, the world is focusing almost all its efforts on <span class="concepts">COVID-19</span> , to the exclusion of other biological threats. The scope of potential biological threats is expansive. Preventing and mitigating <span class="event">future</span> biological events will require a wider lens for viewing biological threats. For example, slow vaccination rates have allowed virus mutations, perpetuating the threat from <span class="concepts">COVID-19</span> . Similarly, failing to address antibiotic resistance could trigger a worldwide <span class="concepts">pandemic</span> involving antimicrobial-resistant organisms within a decade. Research into novel <span class="concepts">diseases</span> has proliferated high-containment laboratories around the world. Some of those labs inadvertently release pathogens into the environment. Some regimes to monitor and regulate these laboratories are perceived by their <span class="person">researchers</span> to be excessively burdensome and restrictive. At the same <span class="concepts">time</span>, the Biological Weapons and Toxin Convention still struggles to find effective ways to enforce its prohibitions on the <span class="concepts">development</span> and production of biological agents and weapons.</p>

	<p>This year, the <span class="place">US</span> Department of State declared that <span class="place">Russia</span> and <span class="place">North Korea</span> possess active biological weapons programs and expressed <span class="concepts">concern</span> about dual-use biological research programs in <span class="place">China</span> and Iran. Terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and ISIS and some criminal organizations continue to profess their determination to build, acquire, and use biological weapons to achieve their goals. The globally inadequate response to <span class="concepts">COVID-19</span>  only serves to underscore that an attack using a weapon containing biological agents designed to resist existing medical countermeasures could provide attackers with some of the tactical, operational, strategic, and economic advantages they seek. The <span class="place">US</span> Department of Defense is now <span class="concepts">concerned</span> enough about that prospect to undertake a biological posture review.</p>

	</figure>

	<p>The world now lives in an age of biological innovation. Many countries and corporations are making enormous investments in biological <span class="concepts">science</span>, bio<span class="concepts">technology</span>, and combinational <span class="concepts">science</span> and <span class="concepts">technology</span> (in which biology combines with other fields), recognizing that they have immense opportunities to establish and grow bio-economies. Innovative biological research and <span class="concepts">development</span> efforts simultaneously increase and decrease biological risk. The field is moving quickly.</p>

	<p>CRISPR-Cas9, the revolutionary genetic engineering tool that <span class="person">scientists </span>in the <span class="place">United States</span> and Sweden discovered in 2012, is cheap and ubiquitous today, spurring investments in genetic testing and adult stem cell technologies. Countries and non-state actors are exploring ways to create super-soldiers, personalize medicine, increase human performance, improve human gene therapy, and synthesize biology. Innovations such as synthetic biology have created new areas of discovery, outpacing current <span class="person">public</span> health, safety, and security measures.</p>

	<p>The world is failing to recognize the multifaceted nature of the biological threat. Advances in biological <span class="concepts">science</span> and <span class="concepts">technology</span> can <span class="concepts">harm</span> us as well as help us. Leaders must recognize that <span class="concepts">COVID-19</span> is not the last biological threat we will have to face in our lifetimes—or, perhaps, even this year.</p>

	<h3>Disruptive <span class="concepts">technology</span> in the age of disinformation</h3>

	<p>The new <span class="place">US</span> administration has done much to reestablish the role of <span class="person">scientists </span>in informing <span class="person">public</span> policy, and even more to minimize deliberate confusion and chaos emanating from the White House. Thoughtful deliberation—merely a promise in January 2021—appears to be realized more often today. On the other hand, disinformation fomented outside the executive branch—including from some members of <span class="event">Congress</span> and many state leaders—appears to have taken root in alarming and dangerous ways.</p>

	<p>Large fractions of <span class="event">Congress</span> and the <span class="person">public</span> continue to deny that <span class="person">Joe Biden</span> legitimately won the presidential election, and their views on these matters appear to be hardening rather than moderating. Similar trends regarding <span class="concepts">COVID</span>-related disinformation are apparent around the world, crippling the ability of <span class="person">public</span> health authorities and medical <span class="concepts">science</span> to achieve higher vaccination rates.  Mask-wearing and social distancing are similarly discouraged by disinformation. While we know more now about the role of social media campaigns in taking advantage of vulnerabilities in human psychology and cognition to spread disinformation and societal disunity, the behavior of social media companies has changed hardly at all. Political attacks on institutions that provide societal continuity and store hard-won knowledge about how best to deal with problems continue apace.</p>

	</figure>

	<p>In cyber conflict, cyberattackers have grown more audacious. The SolarWinds hack, an attack on Microsoft Exchange that affected millions around the world, and a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline (resolved only with the payment of $4.4 million to get the system up and running again) all demonstrate the far-reaching ramifications of cyber-vulnerabilities.</p>

	<p>The good news in cyber includes a <span class="person">Biden</span> executive order and other federal government initiatives on cybersecurity that seem to have significant force and momentum behind them and have gone farther than previous orders and initiatives. The expert cybersecurity team the new administration has assembled has the ear of the president. In addition, against all odds, both the UN Open-Ended Working Group and the Group of Government Experts have reached some rough consensus on cyber norms of behavior. (The first group involves representatives from most of the world’s nations; the latter includes the biggest players in cyber.) It remains to be seen whether these norms actually affect the behavior of national actors in cyberspace, but it is better to have these norms in place (or in the process of being formed and agreed to) than not to have them at all.</p>

	<p>It also appears that Chinese use of surveillance <span class="concepts">technology</span> has reached new heights in Xinjiang in the last year. Artificial intelligence and facial recognition systems intended to reveal states of emotion have been tested on Uyghurs in Xinjiang. In the last year, it has also come to light that <span class="place">China</span> is seeking to <span class="concepts">develop</span> standards for using facial recognition that can be optimized for distinguishing individuals by ethnic group. The potential widespread deployment of these technologies presents a distinct threat to human rights around the world and, therefore, civilization as we know and practice it.</p>

	<p>Finally, tensions over military space activity have increased in the past few years. For example, <span class="place">Russia</span> conducted an anti-satellite missile test in November, destroying one of its own satellites and creating a debris cloud that orbited dangerously close to the International Space Station. <span class="place">Russia</span> has also “injected an object into orbit” that subsequently approached another <span class="place">Russian</span> satellite already in orbit in a manner consistent with its use as an anti-satellite weapon. A similar activity has been used to follow a <span class="place">US</span> government satellite. Press reports have suggested that <span class="place">US</span> Space Command is on the verge of disclosing a new anti-satellite weapon. On the other hand, US officials from the State and Defense departments were reported to be drafting language for a binding UN resolution regarding responsible behavior in space.​ If approved, such language could reduce the likelihood of space incidents taking place.</p>

	<h3>Practical steps to move the world away from <span class="concepts">catastrophe</span> and toward a safer world</h3>

	<p>Last year, we looked forward to the <span class="event">end</span> of the <span class="concepts">COVID-19</span>  <span class="concepts">pandemic</span>—but that <span class="event">end</span> is not yet in sight. Leaders in the wealthiest and most advanced countries have not acted with the speed and focus necessary to manage dire threats to <span class="concepts">humanity</span>’s <span class="event">future</span>.</p>

	<p>Our decision to keep the <span class="event">Doomsday</span> Clock at 100 seconds to midnight is a clear warning to the world: We need to back away from the doorstep of doom. Immediate, practical steps to protect <span class="concepts">humanity</span> from the major global threats that we have outlined are needed:</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>The <span class="place">Russian</span> and <span class="place">US</span> presidents should identify more ambitious and comprehensive limits on <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons and delivery systems by the <span class="event">end</span> of 2022. They should both agree to reduce reliance on <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons by limiting their roles, missions, and platforms, and decrease budgets accordingly.</li>
	  <li>The United States and other countries should accelerate their decarbonization, matching policies to commitments. <span class="place">China</span> should set an example by pursuing sustainable <span class="concepts">development</span> pathways—not <span class="concepts">fossil fuel</span>-intensive projects—in the Belt and Road Initiative.</li>
	  <li>US and other leaders should work through the World Health Organization and other international institutions to reduce biological risks of all kinds through better monitoring of animal-human interactions, improvements in international <span class="concepts">disease</span> surveillance and reporting, increased production and distribution of medical supplies, and expanded hospital capacity.</li>
	  <li>The United States should persuade allies and rivals that no-first-use of <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons is a step toward security and stability and then declare such a policy in concert with <span class="place">Russia</span> (and <span class="place">China</span>).</li>
	  <li>President <span class="person">Biden</span> should eliminate the <span class="place">US</span> president’s sole authority to launch <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons and work to persuade other countries with <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> weapons to put in place similar barriers.</li>

	<p>Without swift and focused action, truly catastrophic events—events that could <span class="event">end</span> civilization as we know it—are more likely. When the Clock stands at 100 seconds to midnight, we are all threatened. The moment is both perilous and unsustainable, and the <span class="concepts">time</span> to act is now.</p>

	<h3>About the Bulletin of the <span class="concepts">Atomic</span> <span class="person">Scientists</span></h3>
	<p>At our core, the Bulletin of the <span class="concepts">Atomic </span><span class="person">Scientists</span> is a media organization, publishing a free-access website and a bimonthly magazine. But we are much more. The Bulletin’s website, iconic <span class="event">Doomsday</span> Clock, and regular events equip the <span class="person">public</span>, policymakers, and <span class="person">scientists </span> with the information needed to reduce manmade threats to our existence. The Bulletin focuses on three main areas: <span class="concepts">nuclear</span> risk, <span class="concepts">climate change</span>, and disruptive technologies. What connects these topics is a driving belief that because humans created them, we can control them. The Bulletin is an independent, nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization. We gather the most informed and influential voices tracking manmade threats and bring their innovative thinking to a global audience. We apply intellectual rigor to the conversation and do not shrink from alarming truths.</p>

	<p>The Bulletin has many audiences: the general <span class="person">public</span>, which will ultimately benefit or suffer from scientific breakthroughs; policy makers, whose duty is to harness those breakthroughs for good; and the <span class="person">scientists</span> themselves, who produce those technological advances and thus bear a special responsibility. Our community is international, with half of our website visitors coming from outside the United States. It is also young. Half are under the age of 35.</p>
